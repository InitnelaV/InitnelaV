For the rest of my profile, it doesn't matter, you can put whatever you like ;)

def InitnelaV_or_something_else():
    card = {}

    card['Name'] = input("Check your Name bro': ")
    card['First Name'] = input("First Name, if you want, or not: ")
    card['Date of birth'] = input("Date of birth (DD/MM/YYYY): ")
    card['Hobby'] = input("Hobby for Bobby? : ")
    card['Address'] = input("Address: ")
    card['Phone'] = input("Phone Number: ")
    card['Email'] = input("Email: ")

    print("\nPlayer's card:")
    for key, value in card.items():
        print(f"{key}: {value}")
